# Cryptocurrency venues

### Fetch order book data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. [Currently supported venues](https://github.com/runeksvendsen/crypto-venues/blob/dc093651d15a19d6d8185454bcf08c1284ab8bfa/src/Venues.hs#L28).

This library enables:

1. Fetching a list of supported cryptocurrency markets for a given exchange/venue
2. Fetching an order book for a given cryptocurrency market
3. Throttling/rate-limiting requests, by using the specific exchange's rate-limit (and backing off if a "Too Many Requests"-HTTP error is received) 

The fetched order books are compatible with the [`orderbook`](https://github.com/runeksvendsen/orderbook) library, which we can then use to query the liquidity of the given market.

## Development

To add support for a new exchange, implement the [`EnumMarkets`](https://github.com/runeksvendsen/crypto-venues/blob/dc093651d15a19d6d8185454bcf08c1284ab8bfa/src/Fetch/EnumMarkets.hs#L16) class (which retrieves a list of supported markets) for the given exchange, as well as the [`MarketBook`](https://github.com/runeksvendsen/crypto-venues/blob/dc093651d15a19d6d8185454bcf08c1284ab8bfa/src/Fetch/MarketBook.hs#L29) class which:

1. Retrieves an orderbook when given a `Market` returned by the `EnumMarkets` implementation
2. Returns the rate limit for fetching orderbooks from the given exchange
